## üìÖ 2nd October 2025 - OpenElectricity v4 Integration & Carbon Intensity

### Changes Made
- ‚úÖ Integrated OpenElectricity v4 API for real fuel-tech breakdown by region
- ‚úÖ Added real-time carbon intensity calculations from measured emissions data
- ‚úÖ Replaced BOM weather API with Open-Meteo for reliability
- ‚úÖ Created GridStatusDashboard component with dual data sources
- ‚úÖ Implemented timezone-aware solar generation (0 MW at night)
- ‚úÖ Added Grid Battery charging/discharging state display
- ‚úÖ Combined coal types (black + brown) into single category
- ‚úÖ Separated Solar into Utility and Rooftop line items
- ‚úÖ Made solar persistent (always shows even at 0 MW)

### APIs Integrated
- **OpenElectricity v4**: `https://api.openelectricity.org.au/v4`
  - `/data/network/NEM?metrics=power&primary_grouping=network_region&secondary_grouping=fueltech`
  - `/data/network/NEM?metrics=emissions&primary_grouping=network_region`
  - API Key: `oe_3ZcWbaVvfvsifQu6ePZEehas` (500 calls/day limit)
  - Provides real fuel-tech breakdown by region (VIC1, NSW1, QLD1, SA1, TAS1)
  - Returns battery, coal (black/brown), gas, hydro, solar (utility/rooftop), wind, distillate
  - Emissions data in tonnes per 5-minute interval

- **Open-Meteo**: `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast`
  - Replaced BOM API for weather and solar irradiance
  - Provides GHI, DNI, DHI solar radiation data
  - Temperature, humidity, cloud cover, wind speed
  - Free, reliable, no authentication required
  - 15-minute caching implemented

### Issues Resolved
- ‚ùå BOM API 404 errors (station IDN60901) - replaced with Open-Meteo
- ‚ùå Solar showing at nighttime - fixed with Australia/Sydney timezone awareness
- ‚ùå Whole-NEM data instead of state-specific - fixed with `primary_grouping=network_region`
- ‚ùå Renewable calculation using wrong field - fixed to use `solar_total`
- ‚ùå Battery math incorrect - fixed net calculation (discharging - charging)

### Architecture Decisions
- **Dual Data Sources**:
  - AEMO: Shows consumption mix (what state consumes, includes imports)
  - OpenElectricity: Shows generation mix (what state produces locally)
  - This explains why VIC shows black coal (imported) vs brown coal (local)

- **Carbon Intensity**: Real calculation from emissions
  - Formula: (emissions in kg per 5 min) / (demand in MWh for 5 min)
  - VIC1 showing ~570 kg CO2/MWh currently
  - More accurate than AEMO estimates

- **Caching Strategy**:
  - Weather: 15 minutes (Map-based cache with TTL)
  - OpenElectricity: 5 minutes recommended (not yet implemented)
  - AEMO: Real-time (no cache)

### Performance Notes
- OpenElectricity API: 500 calls/day limit (monitor usage)
- Parallel fetching for power + emissions data
- Using `primary_grouping=network_region` reduces response size
- External IP-based location detection working reliably

### Production Deployments
- ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub: commit `88cf5e8`
- ‚úÖ Vercel deployment triggered automatically
- üîó Live at: https://batteryiq.com.au/grid-status

### Data Quality Notes
- OpenElectricity fuel-tech data is REAL measured generation
- AEMO data is estimates/aggregates (scheduled + semi-scheduled)
- Night-time solar correctly shows 0 MW (6 AM - 7 PM detection)
- Grid battery shows net flow: negative = charging, positive = discharging
- Import/export data not available in fuel-tech endpoint (investigated, not found)

### Next Session Goals
- [ ] Implement caching for OpenElectricity API calls (5-minute TTL)
- [ ] Monitor API usage to stay under 500 calls/day limit
- [ ] Consider adding historical carbon intensity trends
- [ ] Investigate interconnector flow data from alternative sources
- [ ] Add rooftop solar to AEMO section if available
- [ ] Test with all Australian states (NSW, VIC, QLD, SA, TAS)
