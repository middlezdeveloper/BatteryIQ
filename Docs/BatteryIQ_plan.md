## üîç SEO Strategy & Keyword Research

### Primary High-Intent Keywords (Target First)
- **"battery IQ calculator"** - Brand + tool combination
- **"intelligent battery calculator"** - Brand positioning keywords
- **"smart battery decisions"** - Brand tagline optimization
- **"cheaper home batteries program calculator"** - Federal program exact match
- **"federal battery rebate 2025 calculator"** - High-intent tool searches
- **"can I stack NSW and federal battery rebates"** - Major consumer confusion
- **"VPP capable vs VPP required battery"** - Technical misunderstanding
- **"battery commissioned july 1 2025 rebate eligible"** - Installation timing confusion
- **"9.3 STC per kWh calculator"** - Technical rebate searches
- **"battery rebate worth it 2025"** - Decision-making queries

### 2025 Consumer Confusion Points (SEO Goldmine)
Based on research of actual consumer discussions and official sources:

1. **Installation vs Commissioning Timing**: 
   - **Confusion**: "Can I install before July 1 but get rebate if I turn on after?"
   - **Reality**: Batteries must be commissioned (tested/certified) on/after July 1, 2025
   - **SEO Opportunity**: "installation vs commissioning date battery rebate"

2. **Rebate Stacking Rules**: 
   - **Confusion**: "Can I get both NSW and federal battery rebates?"
   - **Reality**: NSW suspended their rebate when federal started - cannot combine
   - **SEO Opportunity**: "NSW federal battery rebate stacking rules"

3. **VPP Requirements**:
   - **Confusion**: "Do I need to join a VPP to get the rebate?"
   - **Reality**: Must be VPP-capable, but don't need to actually join one
   - **SEO Opportunity**: "VPP capable vs VPP required rebate"

4. **Declining Value Urgency**:
   - **Confusion**: "Should I rush to install before rebates disappear?"
   - **Reality**: Battery rebate declines slower (9.7% yearly) than solar rebate (16.7%)
   - **SEO Opportunity**: "battery rebate declining schedule 2025-2030"

5. **Usable vs Nominal Capacity**:
   - **Confusion**: "Why is my rebate less than expected?"
   - **Reality**: Rebate calculated on usable capacity, not total battery size
   - **SEO Opportunity**: "usable vs nominal battery capacity rebate"

### Content Strategy for BatteryIQ
- **50+ location-based landing pages** ("Sydney Intelligent Battery Calculator", "Melbourne Smart Battery Solutions")
- **Product intelligence pages** ("Tesla Powerwall IQ Test", "Battery Intelligence Comparison")  
- **Decision intelligence pages** ("Smart Battery ROI Calculator", "Intelligent Energy Storage 2025")
- **Authority guides** ("Complete Battery Intelligence Guide", "Smart Rebate Stacking Strategy")
- **Confusion-busting content** ("VPP Capable vs Required Explained", "Installation vs Commissioning Intelligence")
