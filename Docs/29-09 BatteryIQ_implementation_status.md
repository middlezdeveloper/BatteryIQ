## ‚úÖ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 1. Core Calculator Enhancements

**Status: COMPLETE**

- ‚úÖ Fixed state detection bug (postcode 3178 VIC/NSW issue)
- ‚úÖ Added 15kW+ solar capacity option for larger installations
- ‚úÖ Implemented proper energy economics with realistic pricing
- ‚úÖ Added battery model recommendations with price ranges
- ‚úÖ Rebuilt savings calculations using proper arbitrage/storage modeling

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Solar storage savings calculation
const dailySolarGen = userInfo.solarCapacity * 4.2 // 4.2 kWh/kW/day average
const excessSolar = Math.min(dailySolarGen * 0.4, 13.5) // Battery capacity limit
solarStorageSavings = excessSolar * 365 * 0.40 // Store at 5c, use at 45c

// Time-of-use arbitrage
const dailyArbitrage = 13.5 * 0.7 * 0.23 // kWh * efficiency * price differential
arbitrageSavings = dailyArbitrage * 365

// Peak avoidance savings
const peakConsumption = Math.min(dailyUsage * 0.3, 13.5 * 0.8)
peakAvoidanceSavings = peakConsumption * 365 * 0.20
```

### 2. Electric Vehicle Integration

**Status: COMPLETE**

- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive EV questions (4 options total)
- ‚úÖ Implemented "EV within 12 months" for novated leasing capture

3. üéØ "EV within 12 months - Novated lease ready" (evTimeframe: '12months')
4. ‚ùå "No EV plans" (hasEV: false, planningEV: false)

**EV Cost Analysis Implementation:**

const evSavings = {
  petrolCost: annualKm * (6.5/100) * petrolPrices[state], // 6.5L/100km average
  currentPlanCost: annualKm * 0.18 * 0.30, // 0.18 kWh/km at 30c/kWh
  optimizedPlanCost: annualKm * 0.18 * 0.22, // Off-peak charging
  advancedSchedulingCost: annualKm * 0.18 * 0.12 // Solar + battery scheduling
}
```

**State Petrol Pricing Data:**

}
```

### 4. Home Value Impact Analysis

**Status: COMPLETE - RESEARCH-BACKED**

- ‚úÖ Market appeal benefits with buyer preference data
- ‚úÖ Transferable warranty advantages
- ‚úÖ Source citations included (Australian PV Institute, UWA, RealEstate.com.au)

**Corrected Claims:**
- Property value increase: 3-5% (previously incorrectly claimed 85% of system cost)
- Buyer interest: 81% consider sustainability features critical
- Sources: Australian PV Institute, University of Western Australia, RealEstate.com.au

### 5. Post-Installation Guidance

**Status: COMPLETE**

- ‚úÖ Priority insurance notification guidance with specific templates
- ‚úÖ Property record update recommendations
- ‚úÖ Warranty registration and monitoring setup
- ‚úÖ Maintenance scheduling and documentation best practices

**Insurance Notification Template:**
```
What to tell your insurance company:
‚Ä¢ System value: $[systemCost]
‚Ä¢ Installation date: [date]
‚Ä¢ Installer: [installer name]
‚Ä¢ System type: [Solar + Battery/Battery only]
```

### 6. Technical Infrastructure

**Status: COMPLETE**

- ‚úÖ Fixed Prisma import path issues (deployment blocker resolved)
- ‚úÖ Added Suspense boundaries for Next.js App Router compatibility
- ‚úÖ Implemented proper TypeScript enum handling
- ‚úÖ ESLint configuration for production builds

---

## ‚ùå OUTSTANDING ISSUES

### 1. Deployment Pipeline (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Status: REQUIRES MANUAL INTERVENTION**

**Problem:** While code builds successfully locally and commits are in GitHub, the live site at batteryiq.com.au is not reflecting latest changes.

**Potential Causes:**
- Vercel auto-deploy may not be properly configured
- GitHub webhook integration issues
- Production environment missing Prisma generated files
- DNS/CDN caching on custom domain

**Required Actions:**
1. Verify Vercel dashboard configuration
2. Check GitHub ‚Üí Vercel integration settings
3. Confirm auto-deploy is enabled for main branch
4. Review deployment logs for build failures

### 2. SSL Certificate Configuration

**Status: PENDING**

**Issue:** Custom domain batteryiq.com.au showing SSL warnings in some browsers
**Solution:** Typically resolves automatically after DNS propagation completes
**Monitor:** Check if certificate provisions correctly over next 24-48 hours

## üìä DATA SOURCES AND CALCULATIONS

### Australian Energy Market Data

**Solar Generation Assumptions:**
- Average generation: 4.2 kWh/kW/day (national average)
- Self-consumption without battery: ~55%
- Self-consumption with battery: ~85%

**Tariff Structure (c/kWh):**
```typescript
const tariffRates = {
  peak: 45,        // 6pm-9pm weekdays
  offPeak: 22,     // 10pm-7am daily
  shoulder: 30,    // Other times
  feedIn: 5,       // Export rate
  superOffPeak: 12 // EV charging windows
}
```

**Battery Performance Assumptions:**
- Daily cycling efficiency: 70%
- Round-trip efficiency: 90%
- Usable capacity: 13.5kWh (Tesla Powerwall 2 standard)
- Arbitrage opportunity: 23c/kWh (off-peak to peak differential)

- Federal: Up to $4,650 (household size dependent)
- NSW: $1,600 (income ‚â§ $180k)
- VIC: $1,400 (income ‚â§ $210k)
- QLD: $1,200 (income ‚â§ $180k)

2. **81% buyer interest** - RealEstate.com.au buyer survey
3. **Up to $6,000 per kW value add** - Various Australian real estate studies

### Installation Cost Modeling

**System Pricing Structure:**
```typescript
const pricingModel = {
  baseBatteryCost: 16000,      // 13.5kWh system
  installationCost: 4700,      // Labor + electrical
  locationMultiplier: 1.1,     // Metro vs regional
  totalSystemCost: 22770,      // Before rebates
  netCost: 16520              // After typical rebates
}
```

## üéØ STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Opus Planning Review

1. **Calculator Redesign Considerations:**
   - Current calculation engine is sound but could benefit from real-time tariff API integration
   - Consider adding seasonal solar generation variations
   - Implement postcode-specific solar irradiance data (vs national average)

2. **Data Source Upgrades:**
   - Integrate AEMO pricing data for real-time tariff accuracy
   - Connect to live rebate program APIs for automatic updates
   - Add actual installer pricing data vs estimated costs

3. **User Experience Enhancements:**
   - Multi-scenario comparison (different battery sizes)
   - ROI calculator with inflation/electricity price escalation
   - Integration with actual installer booking system

### Outstanding Questions for Opus

1. **Should we integrate real-time AEMO pricing data** for more accurate tariff calculations?
2. **How should we handle seasonal variations** in solar generation (summer vs winter)?
3. **What level of postcode granularity** do we want for solar irradiance data?
4. **Should we build installer marketplace** integration or partner with existing platforms?
5. **How do we want to handle inflation/escalation** in long-term ROI calculations?
