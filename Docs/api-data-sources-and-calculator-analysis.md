# BatteryIQ API Data Sources & Calculator Analysis

*Understanding what data we have, where it comes from, and how our calculator works*

## Overview

This document explains the current state of BatteryIQ's data sources and calculator functionality. Think of this as the "data blueprint" that powers our battery recommendations - what information we can access, what we're missing, and how everything connects together.

## 1. API Integrations & Data Sources

### üå§Ô∏è Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) Weather API

**What it is:** Australia's official weather service providing real-time solar and weather conditions.

**What data we get:**
- **Solar irradiance**: How much sunlight is hitting solar panels right now (measured in watts per square meter)
- **Cloud cover**: Percentage of sky covered by clouds (affects solar generation)
- **Temperature**: Current air temperature (hot panels generate less electricity)
- **UV index**: Strength of UV radiation (correlates with solar generation)
- **Visibility**: How clear the air is (haze/pollution reduces solar output)

**Is it live or historical?**
- ‚úÖ **Live data only** - updated every 15 minutes
- ‚ùå **No historical data** - we can't look back at past weather patterns
- üîÑ **15-minute cache** - we store recent data briefly to avoid overwhelming their servers

**What we use it for:**
- Making solar generation estimates more accurate based on current weather
- Telling users if today is a "good solar day" or "cloudy solar day"
- Adjusting battery charging recommendations based on expected solar output

**Limitations:**
- Can't predict next week's weather for planning
- No seasonal patterns or monthly averages
- Sometimes unavailable (government servers go down)

### ‚ö° AEMO/OpenNEM Grid Data API

**What it is:** Real-time information about Australia's electricity grid - what's generating power, how much it costs, and how clean it is.

**What data we get:**
- **Wholesale electricity prices**: What power companies pay for electricity right now ($/MWh)
- **Renewable percentage**: How much of the grid is currently powered by renewables
- **Carbon intensity**: How much CO2 pollution each kWh of grid electricity creates
- **Energy demand**: How much electricity Australia is using right now
- **Fuel mix**: What percentage is coal, gas, solar, wind, etc.

**Is it live or historical?**
- ‚úÖ **Live data** - updated every 5 minutes
- ‚úÖ **Some historical data available** - OpenNEM has years of historical data we could tap into
- üîÑ **Current implementation**: We only use live data, not historical trends

**What we use it for:**
- Calculating how much money users can save with "energy arbitrage" (buy cheap, use expensive)
- Showing environmental benefits of batteries
- Optimizing when to charge/discharge batteries for maximum savings

**Opportunity:**
- **Historical data goldmine**: We could analyze patterns like "electricity is usually cheapest at 2am on weekdays" or "prices spike during summer heatwaves"
